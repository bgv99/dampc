### Comments
There are 2 types of comments. The first one is single-line comments, and the second one is multi-line comments.

| Comment | Description                        |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| `//`    | A single-line comment.             |
| `/*`    | Beginning of a multi-line comment. |
| `*/`    | End of a multi-line comment.       |

Single-line comments begin with `//` and do not end until the end of the line. Multi-line comments begin with `/*`, and end when `*/` is found.

Examples:
```
// This is a single-line comment.
```
```
/* This is a
multi-line    
comment. */
```
